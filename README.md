Income vs Expense(IvE) basic program for the Tandy Color computer (CoCo).
The idea behind this program is simple. It tracks your income and your expenses with the goal of having not spedning more than you make. 
This program can be used "as is" and I make no guarantee of its operation or use. It is still in development. Feel free to modify the basic code to fit your needs. 

Requirements
A Color Computer 1,2 or 3 with extend color basic. 
Minimum of 64k of RAM. (might be able to get away with 32k)
CoCo SDC

Instructions
Install the IVE.DSK file on your CoCo SDC. Boot your CoCo up and navigated to the IVE.DSK.
Load and Run the IVE.BAS program on the disk. This will start the program. At the initial boot the program will ask you to create a new year disk. Enter the two digit current year to start. The program only track a single year at a time but you can have multiple disk for multiple years. After the splash screen there will be a date page that will give you the option to change the date. This date is used for all entries made after this point. if no action is taken after five second or if the user presses the space bar, the program will advance to the main menu screen. There is a option in the setting section to update the date as well. 

The main menu gives you nine options and siplay a total income and expense value with a cash flow diferrence (+ cash flow or -cash flow).

Option and two will allow you to enter transactions. On the transactions screen it will ask the amount.
Enter the amount and press enter. The next screen will ask for a category. If no categories exists, the program will ask you to enter one.  You can add new categories by entering 99 and adding a new category. Once you select your category, press enter and there will be a confirmation screen, You can press "C" to change, or "A" to add another and save current, or press enter to go to the main screen.

Option three and four will let you list the transactions for either Income, or expense. You can also search for tranactions. For a date search, you will be prompted to select the month. Type in the two digit representation of the month. Leaving this blank will show the whole year. For an amouht search, typoe the numerial value. For a cateregory search type the name of the cateregory. Hint. Youn just need to trp a few characters of nay search and it wil bering up all values witht thoses characters at the beginining of the value.
Option five will give you the month total for all income and expense and the difference. This is useful to see if you are on track or not.

Option six will give you a visual representation of option 5. The bar chart will be broken into all 12 months. If you have more income then expense the green will be on the right had side of the bar. If you have more expenses than income the red will be on the right side of the bar. At the bottom will be the numeric value for the. This number is based of the highest value (Either Income or Expense) in a month and the rests of the months are scaled on that highest number. If the color is blue than you are pretty much even or within the increwment values of each bar block. 

Option seven and eight will give the a category break down of either expenses or income (depending on your selection). 

Option nine will take you tot he settings screen. This screen is broken down in seven options. You can add or delete categories. Clear income, expense or categories data. WARNING. This will delete ALL transactions. Please use caution wit this option. You can backup all data. This will create a disk in named "IVEBU.DSK". It is recommend to backup often. The last option is to close out the year. This will create a closeout disk file and create a new year file. The close out file will be names IVE##-C.DSK. The #### will be the four number (four digits only).
You can go back to the main menu by presses the space bar or the M key.

Shortcuts.
The Spacebar is the default to clear a screen and most likely go back to the main menu. The M key can also take you back to the main screen. There is also a help menu by pressing "H" at certain menus in the program

Things to consider.
The CoCo does not have a lot of memory so there can be delays in reports as more transaction are saved. There is no sorting system for transactions.They will be listed in the order of entry. (Adding a sorting feature took to much memory if there was a lot of transactions.). The more the tranascations the longer it takes to calculate. 

Enjoy.
